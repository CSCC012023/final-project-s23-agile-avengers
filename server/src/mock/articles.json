    "text": "Every business that wants to fund its operations or scale in the future has one thing in common: they all need cash. The cash is required to fund its current operations and fulfill the need to expand and increase profitability. A company can use the revenue to fund its day-to-day operations. But what about growing the business and achieving expansion goals? Expanding the business requires a large number of funds as the company may need to invest in infrastructure, human resources, or acquire new businesses. \n The first alternative for a company to get cash is to take a bank loan. However, companies feel bank loans are tough as they require collateral and are limited to a certain amount. The second and the most widely used way for companies to raise capital is through an Initial Public Offering."

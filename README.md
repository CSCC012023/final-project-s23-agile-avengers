## Motivation

Young adults between the ages of 18-21 face a sudden challenge when they first start interacting with money on
their own especially when they start earning and spending independently. They are overwhelmed by the amount of
advice, valid or not when it comes to interacting with their own money in the context of saving, budgeting,
investing, insuring, and debts. Currently, they use experiential learning methods, which make them prone to making
mistakes and learning from them. But such methods might shape their perspective about money incorrectly and
inefficiently. By delivering optimized support through simulation and learning, Finlearn can help such personas and
provide them with a platform to make those mistakes early on and realize better methods to manage money.

## Product Summary

FinLearn is a financial literacy platform for young adults who are ready to take a step towards an independent
lifestyle. FinLearn introduces young adults to concepts in personal finance and portfolio management through
expert-curated lessons and a sandbox environment to test their learning. This is a zero-liability learning solution
for learning to manage money without the risk of incurring a financial loss.

## Setup Project

This project uses [NPM Workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/workspaces) to manage
both the `client` and `server` dependencies, for more information read the section on
[Install Packages](#install-packages). The `client` folder contains the frontend built using
Next.js and React with Typescript. The `server`folder contains the backend built using Node.js and
Express also with Typescript for the endpoints with database connection to MongoDB Atlas using Mongoose.

### **Requirements**

- [Node.js v18](https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.16.1/)
- [MongoDB Account](https://account.mongodb.com/account/register)

### **Steps**

1. Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CSCC012023/final-project-s23-agile-avengers.git
   ```

2. If you are not using **VS Code** then follow these steps

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. If you are using **VS Code** then follow these steps

   1. Open the Command Palette using `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`
   2. Search for `Tasks: Run Task` and select it
   3. Search for `Setup Project` and select it
   4. VS Code will automatically install all the packages and close the shell.

4. Create a `.env` file inside the `server` folder and copy the following

   ```bash
   PORT=4000
   MONGO_URI='Request Shashwat Piyush Doshi'
   ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY='Register for Alpha Vantage Stocks API'
   ```

5. Create a `.env` file inside the `client` folder and copy the following

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY='Retrieve through Clerk Dashboard'
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY='Retrieve through Clerk Dashboard'

   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/dashboard
   ```

6. To get access to the database register for a MongoDB Account and send
   [Shashwat Piyush Doshi](https://github.com/shashwat-doshi) your account email

7. To get access to the Alpha Vantage Stock API register [here](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key)

8. (Optional) To use the `/webhooks` endpoints follow the instruction under [Wehooks](#webhooks)

### **Start Project**

- If you are not using **VS Code** then follow these steps

  1. Open a new Terminal and run the following command to start Client

     ```bash
        npm run dev -w client
     ```

  2. Open a new Terminal and run the following command to start Server

     ```bash
        npm run dev -w server
     ```

- If you are using **VS Code** then follow these steps
  1. Open the Command Palette using `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`
  2. Search for `Tasks: Run Task` and select it
  3. Search for `Start Dev` and select it
  4. VS Code will automatically Start the Client and Server and you can close them later.

## NPM Workspaces

### **Install Packages**

With [NPM Workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/workspaces#adding-dependencies-to-a-workspace),
you can install dependencies for multiple packages from the root `package.json`.

To install dependencies for the `client` and `server`, run: `npm install <package-name>` \
To install dependencies for `client`, run: `npm install <package-name> -w client` \
To install dependencies for `server`, run: `npm install <package-name> -w server`

### **Running Commands**

With [NPM Workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/workspaces?v=true#running-commands-in-the-context-of-workspaces),
you can run npm scripts for multiple packages from the root `package.json`.

To run a command for the `client` and `server`, run: `npm run <cmd> --workspaces` \
To run a command for `client`, run: `npm run <cmd> -w client` \
To run a command for `server`, run: `npm run <cmd> -w server`

## Webhooks

The Server makes use of Clerk Webhooks for managing new user creation, this is to help
ensure that the user has a profile created in the database automatically when they sign up.
This can be extended to other endpoints to track when a user delete their account or they
started/ended a session on FinLearn.

### **Requirements for Serveo**

For Windows, ensure that you have [OpenSSH Client](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=gui#install-openssh-for-windows)

### **Setup Serveo**

A Webhook is essentially a POST request send from Clerk to our Server. For Clerk to send this
request, it needs an actually URL it can access unlike localhost. We use a service called Serveo
which exposes our local server to the internet for development. To use Clerk Webhooks, follow
these steps below

1. Check if you already have a SSH key pair by running `ssh-keygen`
2. If it asks you to overwrite, provide the response `n` and move to step 5
3. If it asks for a passphrase, provide a passphrase and continue
4. Once it generates the SSH key pair, it will print out your key fingerprint
5. To verify this run `ssh-keygen -l` to check the key fingerprint, below is an example of a fingerprint:

   ```txt
   SHA256:pmc7ZRv7ymCmghUwHoJWEm5ToSTd33ryeDeps5RnfRY
   ```

6. Run this command to start to SSH to Serveo.net: `npm run webhook -w server`
7. If it is your first time it will ask for verification as such, use one of the methods to verify

   ```bash

   > server@0.8.0 webhook
   > ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=60 -R finlearn.serveo.net:80:localhost:4000 serveo.net

   To request a particular subdomain, you first need to register your SSH public key.
   To register, visit one the addresses below to login with your Google or GitHub account.
   After registering, you'll be able to request your subdomain the next time you connect
   to Serveo.

   Google: https://serveo.net/verify/google?fp=...
   GitHub: https://serveo.net/verify/github?fp=...
   ```

8. After verification, rerun `npm run webhook -w server` and you should see the following

   ```bash

   > server@0.8.0 webhook
   > ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=60 -R finlearn.serveo.net:80:localhost:4000 serveo.net

   Forwarding HTTP traffic from https://finlearn.serveo.net
   ```

### **Start using Serveo**

- If you are not using **VS Code** then follow these steps

  - Open a new Terminal and run the following command to start Client

    ```bash
       npm run webhook -w server
    ```

- If you are using **VS Code** then follow these steps
  1. Open the Command Palette using `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`
  2. Search for `Tasks: Run Task` and select it
  3. Search for `OpenSSH Server` and select it
  4. VS Code will automatically Start the SSH and you can close them later.

## Contribution

1. Do you use git flow?

   Yes, we do follow Git Flow in this project.

2. What do you name your branches?

   A branch should begin with a category, reference and description and will be this pattern `category/reference/description`.

   **Category** \
   We support 4 types of branches:

   1. `feature`: Related to features
   2. `bugfix`: Related to fixes for bugs in `develop` branch
   3. `hotfix`: Relates to fixes for bugs in `main` and/or `release/*` branches
   4. `chore`: Anything else

   **Reference** \
   This portion should include a ticket number and must follow the format `\FIN=#\`. If no
   ticket exists then `non-ref` can be used.

3. Do you use GitHub issues or another ticketing website?

   We use JIRA to track all issues that are referenced in PRs and in commits

4. Do you use pull requests?

   Yes, we do use PRs and they must use the Pull Request Template

## Motivation

Young adults between the ages of 18-21 face a sudden challenge when they first start interacting with money on their own especially when they start earning and spending independently. They are overwhelmed by the amount of advice, valid or not when it comes to interacting with their own money in the context of saving, budgeting, investing, insuring, and debts. Currently, they use experiential learning methods, which make them prone to making mistakes and learning from them. But such methods might shape their perspective about money incorrectly and inefficiently. By delivering optimized support through simulation and learning, Finlearn can help such personas and provide them with a platform to make those mistakes early on and realize better methods to manage money.

## Product Summary

FinLearn is a financial literacy platform for young adults who are ready to take a step towards an independent lifestyle. FinLearn introduces young adults to concepts in personal finance and portfolio management through expert-curated lessons and a sandbox environment to test their learning. This is a zero-liability learning solution for learning to manage money without the risk of incurring a financial loss.

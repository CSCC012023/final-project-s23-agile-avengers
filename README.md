## Contribution

1. Do you use git flow ?
    Yes, we do follow Git Flow in this project.
2. What do you name your branches ?
    A branch should begin with a category, reference and description and will be this pattern `category/reference/description`.

    **Category** <br />
    We support 4 types of branches:

    1. `feature`: Related to features
    2. `bugfix`: Related to fixes for bugs in `develop` branch
    3. `hotfix`: Relates to fixes for bugs in `main` and/or `release/*` branches
    4. `chore`: Anything else

    **Reference** <br />
    This portion should include a ticket number and must follow the format `\FIN=#\`. If no
    ticket exists then `non-ref` can be used.

3. Do you use github issues or another ticketing website ?
    We use JIRA to track all issues that are referenced in PRs and in commits

4. Do you use pull requests ?
    Yes, we do use PRs and they must use the Pull Request Template

# FinLearn - Agile Avengers

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

- When: 10/06/2023
- Where: Zoom

## Process - Reflection

- Created a board on [RetroTool](https://retrotool.io/nWOr7XFwbqkaJ64CxS607).
- Everyone filled out Liked, Learnt, and Lacked columns.
- Discussed each entry with the team and reflected on it.

### Decisions that turned out well

- Team Work, Ethic, and Consistency: The way the project is organized and tasks are distributed among team members made it extremely easy to develop the product.
- Assistance from teammate: Team members who were new to a technology or concept asked for help from other team members and they did not hesitate to help out.
- Estimation: Properly defined the amount of work each task took and completed it within the deadline.
- Definition: All tasks were outlined clearly and acceptance criteria was well defined.

### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

- Last min

### Planned changes

- Add a conventional commit linting tool so that team members can focus on actual review while commiting their code.
- Add a reminder in the PR template for the squash merge so that team members will most likely follow the guidelines.

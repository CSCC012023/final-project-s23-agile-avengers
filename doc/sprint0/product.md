# FinLearn - Agile Avengers

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

FinLearn is a financial literacy platform for young adults who are ready to take a step towards an independent lifestyle. FinLearn introduces young adults to concepts in personal finance and portfolio management through expert-curated lessons and a sandbox environment to test their learning. This is a zero-liability learning solution for learning to manage money without the risk of incurring a financial loss.

#### Q2: Who are your target users? (2-3 personas)

- Young adults between the ages of 18-21
- Parents of young adults who understand and value the importance of money but have limited time and resources at their disposal
- High Schools and teachers with some experience handling money but limited expertise in teaching about money

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

- Young adults between the ages of 18-21 face a sudden challenge when they first start interacting with money on their own especially when they start earning and spending independently. They are overwhelmed by the amount of advice, valid or not when it comes to interacting with their own money in the context of saving, budgeting, investing, insuring, and debts. Currently, they use experiential learning methods, which make them prone to making mistakes and learning from them. But such methods might shape their perspective about money incorrectly and inefficiently. By delivering optimized support through simulation and learning, Finlearn can help such personas and provide them with a platform to make those mistakes early on and realize better methods to manage money.

- Parents of young adults who understand and value the importance of money through personal experiences or knowledge gained over adulthood need support to provide such education to their children. They face hardship in imparting this knowledge due to their limited expertise in teaching or limited availability of time and resources. Many parents rely on schools, private tutors, or on themselves to impart this knowledge but these sources could be inefficient, expensive, flawed, or even unavailable in some cases. Finlearn can help such parents in educating their children by providing them with a simulated experience at an inexpensive price which also delivers insights about their childâ€™s investing psyche and make them about the things they need to work on with their child early on.

- High Schools and teachers with some experience handling money but limited expertise in teaching about money because of lack of training or lack of time still need to impart some knowledge about personal finance management to their students. They do so by referring to a limited set of resources and cannot demonstrate the financial management process in real-time. For them, FinLearn can act as an aid in teaching personal finance where they can allocate learning modules to students and monitor students' understanding through the sandbox environment.

#### Q4: What does "DONE" means to your Team

For a given user story/task/subtask:

- The code must pass the linting tests.
- For the backend, the code should pass automated and manual testing using Postman.
- For the frontend, they must pass all unit tests and manual testing.
- Each user story must meet the acceptance criteria outlined before the development of the story.
- The code should be well-documented i.e. A person on the team who is unaware of the code can understand the code. For a frontend page or backend endpoint, the documentation should outline in depth the use cases, the edge cases, etc.

### Highlights

- The MVP for FinLearn will implement the trading simulator and the theoretical learning aspects as outlined in the [Product Vision](https://www.figma.com/file/KbE7OfjSJZwsO2bdE598EU/FinLearn-Product-VIsion?type=design&node-id=1%3A2&t=GeyjOgFiNa2WWR47-1) document. The reason we chose to go ahead with these is that these are the aspects of the platform that have the highest utility and will create the greatest impact on the users.
- Every member of the team will be taking up all kinds of tasks (acting as a full-stack developer) to ensure that everyone gets an experience of everything.
- The team uses JIRA for task allocation, Confluence for documentation, Discord for communication, GitHub for sourcecode management and Git for version control. All of these tools were chosen based on their utility and the familiarity of team members with the tool.
- The database we will implement will be a NoSQL database built using MongoDB Atlas. The NoSQL DB eliminates the requirement for building ER tables and also is more relevant as per industry standards. The cloud provides us with the ability to create a singular database that can be accessed across different devices.
- The UI of the application will be geared towards the target demographic (young adults around the age of 18-25) which was determined after conducting thorough user research and was created while keeping design principles and competitor products in mind.
- The vision of the product is to build a financial literacy platform which provides all the functionality in a sandbox environment in a singular platform as well as provides investing psychology insights to the user based on their activity on the platform.

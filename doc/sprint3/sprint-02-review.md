### Decisions that turned out well

- Good Team work and Collaboration
- Code structure has improved
- Planned work executed on time

### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

- Last minute changes: A bunch of commits happened at the last moment which
  indicates poor estimation of individual members' work.
- Daily standup notes need to be improved.
- Lack of comments on code affects code readability
- Need to understand dependencies of tickets early on.
- UI Responsiveness: Need to improve on the overall UI experience and
  responsiveness.

### Planned changes

- Make dependency chart prior to the sprint
- Imrpove UI design

# FinLearn - Agile Avengers

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

- When: 10/06/2023
- Where: Zoom

## Process - Reflection

- Created a board on [RetroTool](https://retrotool.io/5-DK0cO3X_BqV67ji-zhi).
- Everyone filled out Liked, Learnt, and Lacked columns.
- Discussed each entry with the team and reflected on it.

### Decisions that turned out well

- Team Work, Ethic, and Consistency: The way the project is organized and tasks are distributed among team members made it extremely easy to develop the product.
- Programming and Git Flow practices: Team members are consistently following the best practices for development as well as git flow which has led to a neat and clean reporsitory.
- Right Technologies: Using Git, Figma, JIRA, Confluence for non-technical and MongoDB, ChakraUI, React, NextJS, and Linters has enriched the experience of developing the application.

### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

- Higher than expected learning curve: A lot of members are still getting familiar with the technologies used in the application.
- Conventional Commits: It is hard to keep track of whether the commit name and the branch name is following conventional commit standards.
- Consistency in PR Merging Practices: Team is still getting used to practices like squashing and merging their branches.

### Planned changes

- Add a conventional commit linting tool so that team members can focus on actual review while commiting their code.
- Add a reminder in the PR template for the squash merge so that team members will most likely follow the guidelines.

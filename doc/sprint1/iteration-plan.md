# FinLearn - Agile Avengers

## Iteration 01

- Start date: 05/06/2023
- End date: 21/06/2023

### Process

#### Roles & responsibilities

- Each person takes up a feature and implements the backend as well as the frontend required for it.
- During the implementation, the developer can reach out to anyone else in the team in case they require help.
- Once the implementation is complete, the developer assigns another developer on the team to review their implementation.
- If a person is responsible for implementing something that requires a broader discussion with the team, they are responsible to setup, confirm, and conduct a meeting with the team.
- Every meeting, one person will be responsible to take notes. The entire team will take turns to be the notetaker according to lexicographical order of their names.

#### Events

- Online Meetings everyday at 20:00 and an in-person meeting on Tuesday after class.
- Meetings can be either for standup, sprint planning, sprint review, or ad-hoc purposes.
- Conduct ad-hoc pair programming sessions

#### Artifacts

- We produced a JIRA board and integrated it with GitHub to keep a track of all the ongoing tickets, and their status.
- We produced a confluence board to keep track of all product documentation.
- We used RetroTool to conduct our retrospective meetings and stored the content from the retrospective in our Confluence documents.
- Tasks are assigned to team members as a part of the initial sprint planning, and then if required team members take up unforeseen tasks that are needed to make progress.
- Tasks are prioritized from the backlog based on their impact for the user.
